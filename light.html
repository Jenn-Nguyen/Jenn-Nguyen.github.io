			<h3> Why I Took The Photos</h3>
			<p>
				This photo is an outcome of a photoshoot I did, inspired by Brandon Wolfel. Brandon Wolfel is well known for his light photography. He utilises any light source that he has on hand:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Natural light</li>
				<li>Fairy lights</li>
				<li>Lights from reflections</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I wanted to experiment with these light sources to create an aesthetic look.

			<h3> How I Did It</h3>
			<p>
			In a dim room with LED lights, the coloured lights softly enveloped the area with a cool tone. Using the manual setting on my DSLR camera:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I lowered the ISO to 100: This allowed the camera to capture less light dimming the overall picture. However light was still captured due to the aperture and exposure time/shutter speed.</li>
					<li>Aperture was set to f/4: letting light into the camera. </li>
					<li>The shutter speed was set to 0.5 seconds.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Though next time I would try to lower the value. That way the camera can capture a freeze shot, making the image sharper and crisper, eliminating any sorts of movement. ISO would need to go up a bit to allow the camera to capture the light

		<h3>Editing</h3>
		<p>I used Adobe Lightroom to edit these photos. Changing the:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exposure </li>
				<li>Highlights</li>
				<li>White</li>
				<li>Shadow</li>
				<li>Black</li>
			</ul>
<p>to brighten the photos. This helps to balance out the colours and lighting in the photos. Changing the vibrance and saturation of the photos, Iâ€™m able to control specific colours.
