		<h3> Background Info</h3>
			<p> My first successful night shots of the Melbourne City. This is was New Year’s Eve 2019. My family decided to go see the fireworks, something we do every year for fun. I wanted to utilise this moment to practice night photography and capture some fireworks. That didn’t go as planned, instead I got photos of the city instead.</p>

		<h3> How </h3>
			<p> A tripod would be recommended when doing night photography. It helps to stabilise the camera. I didn’t have a tripod on hand, instead I placed my camera down on the railing of a bridge. I used the manual setting on a DSLR. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Shutter speed/exposure = 3.2”</li>
					<li>Aperture = f/29</li>
					<li>ISO = 1600</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As the place was extremely dark, the shutter speed value was higher, 3.2”. This allowed the camera to be exposed to the light a little longer. The aperture was set to f/29, making the image more focus. Less light will be captured with a high aperture. However setting the ISO to 1600 made the overall image a bit brighter.
