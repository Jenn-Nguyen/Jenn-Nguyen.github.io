					<img src="vietnam.jpg" alt="a bridge in the middle with a hut on either side" class="img__img">
						<p class="img__description"><br><br><br><br>2 years ago, I went to Vietnam to visit relatives. We went to this place where we go hang out and fish. It was like a half fish park half restaurant. I decided to go explore the place and take photos of the scenery. I used the auto setting on my DSLR for this image. 
				 		<br><br>
						I particularly like this image as it captured everyone having fun. Some people in this image are strangers who became friends.
